				<p> 
					Bridger was created by Me (Mike Quinn), a virtual student at Fort Hays State University. I found it difficult to connect with other students and impossible to connect with alumni.
					I wanted a site that would make it easy to network with other people in the same situation. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I live in the suburbs south of Pittsburgh, Pa with his wife Molly and our three kids Jake, Logan, and Lilah. I plan to graduate in December of 2019 with a degree in computer science.
					This is a career change for me since I have worked over 10 years as a bridge designer. I wanted to go back to school for computer science ever since I was introduced to programming.
