					<span class="bridger">Bridger</span> was created to give virtual Students, Alumni,
					and Staff at FHSU a platform to find and network with each other. The creator of Bridger
					found it difficult to find other students local to him to create professional connections.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					To use <span class="bridger">Bridger</span> you need a Facebook account to log-on to our site.
					You can log-in at the bottom of every page. Once logged in you will be able to access your profile page 
					and view the map of other user's locations.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Currently <span class="bridger">Bridger</span> is currently built on a static website. Eventually bridger
					will be moved to a dynamic site and connected to a database. Until then the map is populated using and
					XML file with made up names and locations to give the feel of people using it around the world. If you
					would like us to email you when the website is fully functional send us a message on the "Contact Us"
					page.
